# Categorical-Data-And-Charts
This project is about understanding categorical data from a data science perspective.
Catagorical data is data that can be put into seperate groups that comes together to display data about a certain topic.
In this dataset I was able to create a frequency table. a frequency table is the number of times something happens. In this case its how many sales occured in 3 different locations.
Once I place the data in the table I was ready to visualize the data into different charts.
